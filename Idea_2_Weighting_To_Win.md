# Weighting To Win
As we all know any successful investment portfolios are highly diversified, asset weightings can actually be the difference between <i>making</i> a lot of money versus <i>losing</i> a lot of money.

In 2020 Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming a legitimate investment option almost hitting their 2016 peaks. With many big institutional investors gaining exposure to Cryptocurrencies this gives smaller investors yet another asset class to consider in their portfolios. However, if we are going to include Cryptocurrencies in our portfolio some important questions need to be answered:
 
 - What role do Cryptocurrencies play in a portfolio?
 - Cryptocurrencies have been touted as digital gold but are they <b><i>really</i></b>? 
 - What is the actual relationship with cryptocurrencies and the major share indexes? 
 - And ultimately, if we invest, how much should we invest?  

These are all questions that we seek to answer with our Interactive Portfolio Modelling Dashboard (IPMD). In the IPMD you can enter your starting investment and run analysis on different scenarios to find out how much of your investment you should place in the below assets to help you reach you financial goals.

- Top 5 shares in the S&P500
- Gold and silver commodities 
- Top 3 cryptocurrencies

The results will be delivered to you in a suite of reports including Sharpe Ratios, Correlation Analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to allow you to see the potential returns of your choices over the next 5, 10, 20 or 30 years.


Key questions to the team for discussion...
In the dashboard do we have a tab for each of the different scenarios that we can run? or keep it simple to one scenario with the results being on the different tabs?
Is the coding of the above possible?
