# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Comparison Idea
For this version of the project we would pull financial data using the alpaca API for a handful of large cap stocks as well as the main index.

Once this data has been received and cleaned, the closing prices will be plotted using various python libraries. This data may be referred to as the 'null portfolio'. 

Furthermore, this data will also be run through a series of separate algorithmic trading strategies and backtested, the results will be analysed and plotted to see if these strategies have yielded greater returns and minimised risk. Measures of standard deviation, sharpe ratios and other metrics will be compared. This will be known as the 'experimental portfolio'. 

Once this data has been received it can be used to answer a number of questions. Which algorithmic strategy is best? is it better to simply hold the stock/index fund? Do certain strategies work better for different asset classes such as shares, commodities, crypto, currencies? What is the optimal time frame for these strategies, 1d, 1m, 1min etc.

Lots of possibilities.
